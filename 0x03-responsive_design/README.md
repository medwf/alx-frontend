# 0x03. Responsive Design

## Overview

This project focuses on creating responsive web designs using HTML and CSS. The goal is to ensure that web pages adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users. This involves using concepts like **Mobile-first design**, **media queries**, and various CSS units to create flexible and adaptive layouts.

## Concepts Covered

- **Mobile-first design**: Designing for the smallest screen first and progressively enhancing the experience for larger screens.
- **Media queries**: CSS techniques used to apply styles based on device characteristics such as screen width, height, or orientation.
- **Responsive web design**: A method of designing web pages to look good on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Adaptive vs Responsive design**: Understanding the difference between fixed layouts for different devices (adaptive) and fluid layouts (responsive) that adjust according to screen size.
- **CSS units for flexibility**: Using units like `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`, and percentages to make elements responsive and scalable.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain **Mobile-first design** and why it is important in responsive design.
- Implement **media queries** to create breakpoints for different screen sizes.
- Select appropriate **sizes** (in pixels, percentages, or relative units) for responsive web design.
- Build a website that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Differentiate between **responsive** and **adaptive** design approaches.
- Use **CSS units** that promote flexible layouts, such as `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`, and percentages.
